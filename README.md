Infectious-Disease-Modeling-
A mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations is proposed for a quantitative
description of the outbreak of infectious disease like Covid-19. These models form the basis of
more detailed models currently used by world health organizations, both to predict the future
spread of disease and to develop strategies for containment and eradication. The well-known
SIR models have been around for many years. Under some suitable assumptions, the models
provide information about when does the epidemic occur and when it doesn't and analyze the
outcome mathematically. I will be studying several SIR models and their application, And
try to answer some questions about disease progression in a set population.
